More than once? there was no answer. So I didn&rsquo;t leave my bed. I didn&rsquo;t brush my teeth. Existence seemed to my active imagination a terribly bothersome load.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s another entry into my diary. It&rsquo;s been too long since I introspected, let&rsquo;s look at the past. After all this is my selfish corner of the internet. Why do I have a public dairy? Because you are the other. Whoever you are. You allow me to tell my story, to forge an identity to be a self, to become. So here&rsquo;s a stab at it. I&rsquo;m trying to be authentic. Why do I program?</p><p>At first, long long ago in the world of 2016, it was because hacking was cool, and I don&rsquo;t mean hacking in the proper term of the word. What I meant was <em>cracking</em>, what difference did it make to a noob? I played around with javascript and eventually python. I googled how to learn programming in 30 minutes. I wanted to learn and learn quickly so I could &ldquo;hack&rdquo; stuff. lolololol</p><p>Why? fucking hollywood. It was so fucking cool.</p><p>I quit after two or three weeks. It got so difficult, so quickly and I had to study chemical engineering anyway. I put that shit aside and focused on school. That was that. I forgot that hobby like so many others.</p><p>Fast forward to 2019.</p><p>I pick up programming again. For a very very different reason. I wanted to make money, it was a rational alternative career path. What drove the engine was pure ambition and discipline in my formative months of python syntax. Oh the blasphemy. True programmers are not driven by such &ldquo;basic&rdquo; desires. They are passionate. Whatever the fuck that means. They stared at some for loops at 3 years old, saw some BASIC on some ancient ass computer, began to tinker and never looked back. A great desire sparked. It was love at first sight, with IQs > 200 and touch typing at 140wpm these are the stallions.</p><p>Oh the horror! how my motives pale from such hackers. I am mediocre, bottom of the barrel. I got access to a computer at 13 or 14. The very first one. It was my mum&rsquo;s. She wanted to write her phd. Computers were a luxury back then, at least in my family. I tinkered with solitaire, ping pong, Mario, some beach fps I forget the name&mldr;I discovered porn and masturbation. Thank God for modems. Computers were cool I guess. Wtf was programming? Shit I didn&rsquo;t know. There was this weird looking thing, a &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; cmd. You could input instructions into it and stuff happened. &ldquo;Magic&rdquo;. The task manager shortcut - a black art. It was wonderfully complex. Too complex for my tiny little head.</p><p>I was driven to program for the first time in my life seriously in 2019 by ambition and upward social mobility as the sociologists say, but it wasn&rsquo;t why I kept programming. There&rsquo;s a little more to this story. Humans are wonderfully complex, I won&rsquo;t strive for accuracy or consistency but honesty in expression.</p><p>Today? It isn&rsquo;t even the major reason I code.</p><p>So I&rsquo;ll ask you again? Why do you program?</p><p>Today? I&rsquo;m going to code python because I have an assignment that&rsquo;s due on EdX. I think I&rsquo;m also going to write ruby and solve an advent of code puzzle. But that&rsquo;s not a reason is it? why you might ask?</p><p>In all honesty? It&rsquo;s because I believe deep down within me think that if I do these things to the best of my ability? <strong>I&rsquo;ll become a better programmer</strong>. I have faith. This isn&rsquo;t a rational faith, there&rsquo;s no way to know for certain, that I will afterall become better.</p><p>So two questions arise here? What is &ldquo;better&rdquo; and why?</p><p>Better is simple, write less shitty code than you did 6 months ago. It&rsquo;s simple. Because let&rsquo;s be honest, it&rsquo;s almost 2021 and I have a O(n^3) algorithm on my github. I have mountains of unfinished projects. I don&rsquo;t know half of the things I want to know. Now the hard part? why would you want to become a better programmer anyway?</p><p>Because I want to be successful at this. I wanna make money, but I want to make money because I&rsquo;m good at what I do. Why do I want money? I want to live. I think. As I see fit. I want to paint my nails or not, I want piercings or not, I want to keep my hair long or not, I want to see the world or not, I want to live free as I see fit until I die. I&rsquo;d rather not call pieces of shit &ldquo;sir&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d rather not become a shell of myself, fuck happiness, If I wanted that, I&rsquo;d do drugs. I want to piss away my meaningless existence how I want to. Why? suicide seems boring, and a mediocre life even more so. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll marry. I don&rsquo;t think. Kids? I&rsquo;m not cruel enough to birth more life. The propagation of this curse I leave to others, then how am I to spend my time? pissing away existence. There isn&rsquo;t much of it anyway. Nothing I do is terribly important.</p><p>Another dimension, why did I keep writing code? I haven&rsquo;t made a dime from this. I&rsquo;ve been at this for a little bit. One year and five or so months seriously. There was no prize dangling in front of me. On the contrary, it was filled with uncertainty and g_ood reasons_ not to continue to program.</p><p>Riddle me this? is faith in I&rsquo;m going to become a better programmer enough? and consequently will that mean success? Is that enough reason to code? I think not. It&rsquo;s irrational. It makes no sense, your brain will realize this and you&rsquo;ll quit, find something more profitable, or simply go through the motions expecting that eventually you&rsquo;ll reach your goal if enough time passes.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t like to program, I still don&rsquo;t for several reasons. It makes me feel stupid, all the time. It doesn&rsquo;t do what I want it to do. It&rsquo;s an intrinsically difficult activity. It ruins my posture, it&rsquo;s ruined my eyes. I don&rsquo;t see sunlight anymore. It frustrates me to no end. Debugging is just the worst. It feels like you&rsquo;ve hit a wall you have no idea how to overcome. The compiler is always mean, programming languages are annoying. I don&rsquo;t have many hobbies that aren&rsquo;t on the internet. It&rsquo;s all programming&rsquo;s fault. It has changed me. I care about weird things. I admire people better than me, I want to be like them, I compete with my peers. I hate ugly code, but I haven&rsquo;t seen perfect code either. It takes the best of my mental energy. I have no idea how to balance technical books I like with books that I like that are technical in some other field I have interests in. It has consumed me. I think code. I breathe code, and I still suck.</p><p>God I suck. It&rsquo;s shameful.</p><p>I hate programming. It&rsquo;s consumed me, and I like that. I like how much I like this. Which is something I hate about myself now. I know. It&rsquo;s destroying parts of me. I used to keep count of the hours I spent doing this. I&rsquo;ve forgotten to keep count. I wake up and code until mental exhaustion sets in and i like this.</p><p>I like when the program does what I want it to. I feel something close to a brief ecstasy when I fix a bug. I pride myself on useless things.</p><p>I kept programming because it was a center. This was my world. Me. No one else, it was private. It wasn&rsquo;t about you. It wasn&rsquo;t about them. Here, I learned more about myself. I learned, I enjoy difficult things. I want to challenge the gods, I like the ultra immersion, I want to say a quiet fuck you to all my shitty lecturers. I really really want to say a quiet fuck you to Nigeria and it&rsquo;s values. To all of human society and it&rsquo;s vision of how one should live life.</p><ul><li>Haile Lagi a decaying mass of carbon and assorted fun molecules in entropy.</li></ul></article></main><footer id=footer><a href=https://github.com/hailelagi/blog>Copyright © 2025 Haile Lagi</a><div><span>private inquiries: hailelagi[at]gmail.com</span></div><div><span>or informally(twitter/x): https://x.com/haile_lagi</span></div></footer></body></html>
