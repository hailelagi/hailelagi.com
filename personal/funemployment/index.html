Burnout is an overloaded term in the software industry, often it&rsquo;s taken to
mean accumulated stress from working too much. That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p><p>I&rsquo;m burntout in the sense that what&rsquo;s wrong isn&rsquo;t my workload, but what I have had to work on, maintain and
how that makes me feel about myself and what I create and put out into the world.</p><p>It wasn&rsquo;t all bad &ndash; I learnt a lot of interesting things, I think &ndash; but it slowly eroded
my soul to the point that I just feel a general sense of apathy towards making software.</p><h2 id=rent-coffee-bread>Rent? Coffee? Bread?</h2><p>That is something that scares me. This decision places me dangerously in <a href=https://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html>default dead</a>,
