Sparked by the decisions and shifts in cultural
expectations arising out of twitter, the question has been popping up lately and
140 characters isn&rsquo;t enough room, so here we are?</p><p>In my opinion this question is defined by four broad concepts:</p><ol><li>Problem space</li><li>Incentive alignment (see: <a href="https://nav.al/principal-agent#:~:text=A%20principal%20is%20an%20owner%3B%20an%20agent%20is%20an%20employee&amp;text=In%20this%20case%20it's%20a,an%20agent%20as%20an%20employee.">principal vs agent problem</a>)</li><li>Internal vs extrinsic motivation</li><li>Unlimited PTO</li></ol><h3 id=problem-space>Problem Space</h3><p>The first and arguably most important question, what is the problem space you&rsquo;re trying to solve?
A problem space does not need to be extremely difficult and require a high skill level to be
useful to society, function as a business or run as a company.</p><p>What are the bounds? There is insane variance when it comes to writing software.</p><p>Writing a game engine from scratch for example isn&rsquo;t building a distributed system serving millions doing complex logic. A small
node.js app running on heroku serving 10k requests a month can be doing something
extremely useful in society unlocking value for a lot of people.</p><p>Not all problem spaces demand a serious work ethic or mode of operation.</p><h3 id=incentive-alignment>Incentive Alignment</h3><p>If you want to delegate work to someone else, and you want them to work as hard as they can,
there&rsquo;s a level of sacrifice in ownership and control required. It requires trust and respect
that the person on the other side will execute with freedom to do as they see fit.</p><p>This is explained best in my experience by Graham Duncan with the idea of a <a href=https://grahamduncan.blog/letter-to-a-friend-who-just-made-a-lot-of-money/>decision space.</a></p><p>There&rsquo;s a large spectrum on different agreements that solve the agent vs principal problem, insanely varied levels
of autonomy, decision spaces and incentive models. The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)>schelling point</a>
is different from one company and industry to the next.</p><h3 id=internal-vs-extrinsic-motivation>Internal vs extrinsic motivation</h3><p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you&rsquo;re giving ownership or are solving an important hard problem.
Whoever is on the other end has to want it for their own reasons.
You can&rsquo;t ask someone to sacrifice their life in service of building something no matter how
great. It often requires painful sacrifices.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t really threaten someone into productivity. Forcing people to work under threat of losing
their jobs may work temporarily but any rational actor will escape that situation eventually.</p><h3 id=unlimited-pto>Unlimited PTO</h3><p>I don&rsquo;t know about making anything else, but in my experience/opinion I cannot operate at
a fixed rate of production. Knowledge work is not an assembly line where you can see consistent output.</p><p>If I had to give arbitrary figures think 60-70% over a 40 hour week is a bad model. It&rsquo;s more like
-30% - 5000% over a sporadic period of time. I sprint intensely and take breaks. Without these
breaks my mind breaks down into a fog and it begs me to do something anything mindless.</p><p>This rate of production depends again on what the output is. Is it something I already know how to do?
Is the output hundreds of api endpoints doing a different version of CRUD?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a question of sitting for 6 to 9 hour stretches a day churning out code.</p><h3 id=finally>Finally</h3><p>I believe in working as <strong>hard as is humanly possible</strong>, I must, I&rsquo;m not nearly smart enough to think otherwise.
The real world is messy and to create almost anything even of little value you have to give it your all to stand a chance.</p><p>Sometimes that means working really hard for longer streches of time than I am comfortable with,
these are external constraints. I take what is given and do what I can.</p></article></main><footer id=footer><a href=https://github.com/hailelagi/blog>source</a>
