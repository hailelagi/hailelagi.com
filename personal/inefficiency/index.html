At any moment in time - valuable work is <em>discovered.</em> It&rsquo;s not self-evident before you begin what the final shape of something is, can be or will be &ndash; when the thing gets built it&rsquo;s <em>imperfect</em> and there is universally always a way to improve it - but it doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p>You can always find work to do, do you care about it? does anyone?</p><p>You&rsquo;re blind. Feel in the dark, experiment with reality - Ship demos - feedback is king. Thinking about what is &ldquo;good&rdquo; is bad, you don&rsquo;t know, other people <em>definitely</em> don&rsquo;t know, not until they try <em>something</em>. Make something and ask what is good? It&rsquo;s not your job to come up with <em>answers</em> only questions, and ways to ask them, ideally quickly.</p><p>You&rsquo;re not in the business of building the <em>best thing</em>, you&rsquo;re in the business of building things that are useful. It just so happens that some things are the best because they&rsquo;re useful, both feedback loops feed into each other, but one comes first <em>it&rsquo;s useful</em>, you&rsquo;re not going to build a giant &ldquo;good idea&rdquo; mouse trap and people magically fall into it.</p><p>You lack pedigree - you&rsquo;re just a random anon on the internet. It&rsquo;s supposed to be hard. If it wasn&rsquo;t obvious, it&rsquo;s an uphill battle anyway you roll the dice.</p><p>You need to always be <em>testing</em> your theory and ideas. Throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks, do this intelligently &ndash; there&rsquo;s a finite amount of times you can try the same thing before variance is no longer statistically significant.</p><p>You need to recognise bad ideas and dig yourself out of sunk costs.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not about being really smart or knowing lots of stuff (although this helps) - you need the barest minimum competency to <em>test and iterate</em> and the bigger the bar of closing the execution loop the further in danger you are - you know this, why are you learning complicated things?</p><p>There&rsquo;s no book or tutorial that can teach you how to do this.</p><p>Are you just intellectually masturbating by saying &ldquo;things take time&rdquo;?</p><p>Are you bad at selling? get good.
Are you bad at talking to people? get good.
You don&rsquo;t have good ideas? execute and test bad ones - what do you learn?</p><p>Urgency is important. Stop thinking about multiple things. Pick one thing only one thing. Test it, can it. Fail at it.</p></article></main><footer id=footer><a href=https://github.com/hailelagi/blog>Copyright © 2024 Haile Lagi</a><div><span>private inquiries: hailelagi[at]gmail.com</span></div><div><span>or informally(twitter/x): https://x.com/haile_lagi</span></div></footer></body></html>
