<meta property="og:image" content="/favicon-32x32.png"><meta itemprop=image content="/favicon-32x32.png"><meta name=twitter:image content="/favicon-32x32.png"><meta name=twitter:image:src content="/favicon-32x32.png"></header><p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href=../funemployment>fun?/unemployed</a> now for a full quarter of 2024 &ndash; an eternity in startup time where it could mean staving off death or finding yourself in a peculiar <a href=https://www.paulgraham.com/pinch.html>common form of death</a>, perhaps worth highlighting, given three months is long enough that most people on the other side of a resume will increasingly read the situation as:</p><blockquote><p>The company is now starting to read as a failure. The first time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it was too early to ask. Now it&rsquo;s possible to ask that question, and the default answer is failure, because at this point that is the default outcome.</p></blockquote><p>Maybe harsh, but it makes sense. The longer you&rsquo;re out of a job the more likely you&rsquo;re percieved as unhireable and your <em>default trajectory is bad</em>. I&rsquo;m not writing this for those people though. I write as a way to think. Maybe if I can put words down I can think clearly and ring alarm bells that might be silent, even better I might get feedback that helps.</p><p>Paul Graham&rsquo;s advice is about how to <em>run a business</em> but businesses are not necesssarily unlike careers. There are options but the suggested panacea is simple, do whatever it takes to increase revenue. Take whatever jobs/do whatever you can and focus on survival. Cut expenses ruthlessly.</p><p>The problem is simple.</p><p>I am undesirable for the jobs/opportunities I want.
The market for software engineering has shrunk, changed with AI, remote first is increasingly a non-starter conversation
and my background/history is not impressive enough.</p><p>There are two important questions to constantly ask in changing this trajectory.</p><blockquote><ol><li>What did you get done this week?</li><li>How long until you can no longer afford to eat?</li></ol></blockquote><p>Question one boils down to two things.</p><ol><li>Are you increasingly applying/adapting more effectively?</li></ol><p>Maybe. I guess? There&rsquo;s only so many ways to word things that happened in the past and that are no longer in your immediate control, there&rsquo;s no way to upsell my years of experience unless I want to blatantly lie which is boring. There&rsquo;s always a way to sell yourself better but I&rsquo;m especially unmotivated by writing/fine-tuning resumes/cover letters. Idk. It <em>also</em> doesn&rsquo;t help that half my applications are to roles I&rsquo;m interested in &ndash; but not necessarily extensively &ldquo;experienced in&rdquo;, maybe there&rsquo;s two lessons here:</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;m not applying enough.</li><li>I need to lower my ambitions, dramatically.</li></ul><ol start=2><li>Has your skill level dramatically changed?</li></ol><p>This feels better to focus on, the answer is no &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/hailelagi?tab=overview&amp;from=2024-03-01&amp;to=2024-03-31">but, progress</a>. It seems like there&rsquo;s something to be done about that problem &ndash; maybe too much. Unlike what most people assume there&rsquo;s an abundant amount of work (<em>see: opportunity</em>) that needs to get done and <em>almost universally</em> not enough competent people to work on it, our AI overlords aren&rsquo;t quite helping yet.</p><p>Gaining technical experience is simple, just go work on whatever direction you&rsquo;re interested in. Odds are what you produce is totally crap, but you can iterate and in iterating quickly, there&rsquo;s a suprising pool of of people who will magically appear to aid your quest. There&rsquo;s an abundance of knowledge to be digested about writing software it will take you ten years to get some footing and then &ndash; there&rsquo;s more to know/do. It will never be enough. Which leads to only natural conclusion, produce enough good work, create/solve interesting problems <strong>that people care about</strong> and somehow you&rsquo;ll get the chance to create shareholder value :) for the &ldquo;economy&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=the-plan-wtf-am-i-even-doing>The plan™️ (wtf am I even doing?)</h2><p>Keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing for six months(3/6 spent)? make more progress, until I&rsquo;m just about to run out of money&mldr; then.. idk. Go back home and cry to my parents?</p><p><img src=/fresh.jpeg alt="sponge bob standing infront of a banner about a job"></p></article></main><footer id=footer><a href=https://github.com/hailelagi/blog>source</a>
