and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.</p></blockquote><p>In a lot of strategy games, there&rsquo;s a game mechanic that can be introduced known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war>fog of war</a>.
When one begins to learn a new body of knowledge like say mathematics, elden ring or computer science you experience a similar mental state.
You&rsquo;re an explorer, there&rsquo;s alot of stuff <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aporia>it&rsquo;s all very confusing</a>.</p><p>You open an &ldquo;introduction to X&rdquo; textbook and dive in, it&rsquo;s typically structured somewhat linearly. Early concepts build on future concepts, you take some
isolated pocket, explore it somewhat and move on. Eventually after a textbook(or the equivalent), you think &ldquo;huh I kind of get it&rdquo;. In order to program there
are very few concepts you need to actually build software &ndash; they&rsquo;re all abstractions over <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal>voltage or the lack thereof</a>.</p><ul><li>data types</li><li>control structures that allow you to do:<ol><li>sequential processing</li><li>decision making and</li><li>repetition</li></ol></li></ul><p>Yet, this is an illusion sometimes illustrated as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation>map-territory relation</a>.
It&rsquo;s an often not fully appreciated concept that a human at any point in time has an incomplete model of the world &ndash; and by necessary extension our work.</p><p>How then can we define competency? &ndash; Honestly? it&rsquo;s just consensus.</p><p>If we model all things that <em>are known</em> about some field as a three-dimensional graph, we can squint and draw arbitrary lines over the &ldquo;current territory&rdquo;.
Now the thing is &ndash; this graph is <strong>really big, and it changes</strong>.. so we draw multiple lines, sometimes they intersect, sometimes then don&rsquo;t. The thing is&mldr; every node in this
graph is not necesarily connected &ndash; or more precisely you aren&rsquo;t aware where you are.</p><p>Humans are weird. We&rsquo;re fundamentally social creatures. There are many <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language>interesting theories</a> about how this got started.
We needed to communicate with each other, a basis on which to share perception.</p><p>This shared perception lends itself to be a <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1882010>consensus-communication problem</a>.</p><p>In the model of a capitalistic world, a job is a function determined by the ability to draw upon some arbitrary sub-set as a base and perform some activity
that generates a profit and provides some value to a society.</p><p>Should every programmer know what <a href=https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html><code>mmap(2)</code></a> is?</p><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to know what you know? Often it seems the ground is ever shifting, the &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean the same thing across
different contexts &ndash; depending on where you&rsquo;re operating on what sub-set or overlapping set and most importantly who you ask.</p><p>How you explore this graph matters.. of course. There are circles of mastery, sub-sets. There are self-contained nodes.
Nodes that have value are nodes that reach consensus because somehow they generate value for society.</p><p>How do you know what has value? You don&rsquo;t, not your peers or the experts nor does any member of society apriori.</p><p>The meta question.. what should I be working on?</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1zDuOPkMSw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Is worthy of serious consideration. Answering it seems to be nearly an accidental discovery via iterative experiements. You explore and most likely you&rsquo;re going to fail. <em>There is no royal road to geometry</em> indeed.</p></article></main><footer id=footer><a href=https://github.com/hailelagi/blog>source</a>
