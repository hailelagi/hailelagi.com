and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.</p></blockquote><p>In a lot of strategy games, there&rsquo;s a game mechanic that can be introduced known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war>fog of war</a>.
When one begins to learn a new body of knowledge like say mathematics, elden ring or computer science you experience a similar mental state.
You&rsquo;re an explorer, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aporia>it&rsquo;s all very confusing</a>.</p><p>You open an &ldquo;introduction to X&rdquo; textbook and dive in, it&rsquo;s typically structured somewhat linearly. Early concepts build on future concepts, you take some
isolated pocket, explore it somewhat and move on. Eventually after a textbook(or the equivalent), you think &ldquo;huh I kind of get it&rdquo;. In order to program there
are very few concepts you need to actually build software &ndash; they&rsquo;re just a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine>fancy model</a> built over <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal>voltage or the lack thereof</a>.</p><p>Yet, this is an illusion sometimes illustrated as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation>map-territory relation</a>.
It&rsquo;s an often not fully appreciated concept that a human at any point in time has an incomplete model of the world &ndash; and by necessary extension our work.</p><p>How then can we define competency? &ndash; Socially, it&rsquo;s just consensus.</p><p>In practice, it&rsquo;s playing at/with the boundary of knowledge.</p><p>If we model all things that <em>are known</em> about some field as a graph, we can squint and draw arbitrary lines over the &ldquo;current territory&rdquo; some subset pre-requisite to accomplish a task (or more commonly what is <em>believed to be</em>).</p><p>Humans are weird. We&rsquo;re fundamentally social creatures. There are many <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_language>interesting theories</a> about how this got started. We needed to communicate with each other, a basis on which to share perception.</p><p>In the model of a capitalistic world, this shared perception lends itself to be a <a href=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1882010>consensus-communication problem</a>, signalling some virtue can be almost as valuable as the virtue itself.</p><p>Should every programmer know what <a href=https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html><code>mmap(2)</code></a> is?</p><p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to know what you know? More precisely what you don&rsquo;t.</p><p>Often it seems the ground is ever shifting, the &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean the same thing across different contexts &ndash; depending on where you&rsquo;re operating on what sub-set or overlapping set and who you ask.</p><p>How you explore this graph matters.. of course. Resources are finite &ndash; you can&rsquo;t learn it all or do it all . There are circles of mastery. Some intersection of this effects the world and produces magic - something new and redefines our shared perception
of what&rsquo;s useful.</p><p>It&rsquo;s entirely possible to be driven by <a href=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html>pure intellectual curiousity</a> and this can be a beautiful noble pursuit and it&rsquo;s entirely independent on if or how this effects the world.</p><p>However if you&rsquo;re interested in how your work fits into the world, for whatever reason, ambition, moral principle whatever. It&rsquo;s the litmus test. How do I know what matters?</p><p>How does anyone know what has value? You don&rsquo;t, not your peers or the experts nor does any member of society apriori.</p><p>The meta question.. what should I be working on?</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1zDuOPkMSw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Is worthy of serious consideration. Answering it seems to be nearly an accidental discovery via iterative experiements&mldr; and seemingly luck. You explore and most likely you&rsquo;re going to fail.</p><p>What you end up doing is luck, but that you <em>do something</em>, that you prepare yourself is not.
<em>There is no royal road to geometry</em> indeed.</p></article></main><footer id=footer><a href=https://github.com/hailelagi/blog>source</a>
