tldr; I quit my day job! <3

**Update - Dec 30th 2023**

I didn't want to speculate/burn bridges by detailing the reasoning why I resigned but
there were warning signs -- a lack of transparency e.g (I still haven't been paid for my last month),
high "bug" rates and invariants that made no sense among others lead me to suspect something was very wrong and
my only real option was to resign -- I didn't realise the full extent:

This... sucks, terribly.

**End Update**

## Why?

Simply I'm burntout. Burnout is an overloaded term in the software industry, often it's taken to
mean accumulated stress from working too much. That's not what I'm talking about.

I'm burntout in the sense that what's wrong isn't my workload, but what I have had to work on, maintain and
how that makes me feel about myself and what I create and put out into the world.

It wasn't all bad -- I learnt a lot of interesting things, I think -- but it slowly eroded
my soul to the point that I just feel a general sense of apathy towards making software.

## Rent? Coffee? Bread?

That is something that scares me. This decision places me dangerously in [default dead](https://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html),
for the first time in my adult life. Making money is hard.

## What now?

I'll be enjoying funemployment, pick up on the books I never had the time for, maybe write a compiler or
database, who knows?

But.. I want to find work I can love again by [doing things that don't scale](https://www.paulgraham.com/ds.html).
