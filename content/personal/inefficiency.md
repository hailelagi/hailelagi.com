NOTE TO SELF.

The world - In general is an _inefficient_ place. At any moment in time - valuable work is _discovered._ It's not self-evident before you begin what the final shape of something is, can be or will be -- when the thing gets built it's _imperfect_ and there is universally always a way to improve it - but it doesn't matter.

You can always find work to do, do you care about it? does anyone?

You're blind. Feel in the dark, experiment with reality - Ship demos - feedback is king. Thinking about what is "good" is bad, you don't know, other people _definitely_ don't know, not until they try _something_. Make something and ask what is good? It's not your job to come up with _answers_ only questions, and ways to ask them, ideally quickly.

You're not in the business of building the _best thing_, you're in the business of building things that are useful. It just so happens that some things are the best because they're useful, both feedback loops feed into each other, but one comes first _it's useful_, you're not going to build a giant "good idea" mouse trap and people magically fall into it.

You lack pedigree - you're just a random anon on the internet. It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't obvious, it's an uphill battle anyway you roll the dice.

You need to always be _testing_ your theory and ideas. Throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks, do this intelligently -- there's a finite amount of times you can try the same thing before variance is no longer statistically significant.

You need to recognise bad ideas and dig yourself out of sunk costs.

It's not about being really smart or knowing lots of stuff (although this helps) - you need the barest minimum competency to _test and iterate_ and the bigger the bar of closing the execution loop the further in danger you are - you know this, why are you learning complicated things?

There's no book or tutorial that can teach you how to do this.

Are you just intellectually masturbating by saying "things take time"?

Are you bad at selling? get good.
Are you bad at talking to people? get good.
You don't have good ideas? execute and test bad ones - what do you learn?

Urgency is important. Stop thinking about multiple things. Pick one thing only one thing. Test it, can it. Fail at it.
