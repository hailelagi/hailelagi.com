Essay into the mind of a learning self taught v2.1

I think to answer complex important questions, it's important to realize there isn't necessarily a singular path.

There are often parallels between answers and methodologies. Often overlapping in how they guide the process, meaning the overall outcome is simply all that's important given constraints. It's funny, because I've never internalized this. I've always had this deep rooted belief that conclusions should be universal to be true. I've seen people say the exact same thing about something and mean completely different things by it. This isn't a matter of context or interpretation, although they play somewhat of a role. I think it's about understanding. How we learn about things and model the world. Someday somehow maybe eventually try to conciously influence it rather than forfeiting to be casual dominoes in choice. I won't say I like the idea of programming entirely. I don't like sitting for hours on end, sometimes wasting significant mental effort on something that was just... ugh. However, I do like how intellectual it can be. It acknowledges the weakness of the human mind and instead ceases control to the computer which will always beat you at remembering and computing complex iterations. Instead it focuses the mind on what the mind does best and what the computer is hopeless to achieve (yet).

Till another time,
