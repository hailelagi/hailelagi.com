Hi, I'm Haile (pronunciation: [haɪlə](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haile_Selassie.ogg)). 

I'm currently learning distributed systems, cryptography and web assembly.

I primarily write [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) these days, I used to write a fair bit of ruby, javascript
and some go. I hope to write more elixir and/or [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

My interests outside **computer science** are primarily **philosophy** and **economics**. I'm currently reading: _The little Ecto Cookbook_

I am _always_ looking for great recommendations! via [github](https://gist.github.com/hailelagi/26263ee81eebd06c5e62b98617854581)
