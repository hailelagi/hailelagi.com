Hi, I'm Haile (pronunciation: [haɪlə](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haile_Selassie.ogg)). 

I currently work at [juice](https://spendjuice.org/), I was previously at [buycoins](https://buycoins.africa/),
now [hellicarrier](https://helicarrier.studio/). Before that, I went off to get a degree in chemical engineering, and I 
learned I like writing code a lot more than solving differential equations.

I primarily write [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) these days and I used to write a fair bit of ruby, javascript and some go.
I've recently been experimenting with rust but primarily focused on getting my first principle fundamentals down.

I'm currently exploring:
 - algorithms and data structures
 - cryptography basics
 - [testing elixir](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/testing-elixir/9781680508918/)
 
My interests outside computer science are primarily philosophy and economics. My current bookshelf(June
[and now july...backlog lol]) is:
 - [existentialism is a humanism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51985.Existentialism_is_a_Humanism)

Stuff I've read recently:
 - ~~[elixir in action](https://www.notion.so/Elixir-in-Action-Book-review-27ff4cbe67f140a688637e1422f11641)~~
 - ~~how to solve it - George Pólya ~~
