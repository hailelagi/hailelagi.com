Hi, I'm Haile (pronunciation: [haɪlə](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haile_Selassie.ogg)). 

I'm currently trying to help talented people build [catalyx](https://catalyx.io).

I was previously at [juice](https://spendjuice.org/), before that [buycoins](https://buycoins.africa/) 
([hellicarrier](https://helicarrier.studio/)). Long before that, I went off to get a degree in chemical engineering, and I 
learned I like writing code a lot more than solving differential equations.

I primarily write [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) these days, I used to write a fair bit of ruby, javascript
and some go. I hope to write more elixir and/or [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

My interests outside **computer science** are primarily **philosophy** and **economics**. I'm currently reading: _Concurrent data processing in elixir_

I am _always_ looking for great recommendations! via [github](https://gist.github.com/hailelagi/26263ee81eebd06c5e62b98617854581)
