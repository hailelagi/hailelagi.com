Hi, I'm Haile (pronunciation: [haɪlə](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haile_Selassie.ogg)). 

I currently work at [juice](https://spendjuice.org/), I was previously at [buycoins](https://buycoins.africa/),
now [hellicarrier](https://helicarrier.studio/). Before that, I went off to get a degree in chemical engineering, and I 
learned I like writing code a lot more than solving differential equations.

I primarily write [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) these days and I used to write a fair bit of ruby, javascript
and some go. I've recently been experimenting with [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I'm currently exploring:
 - [building with rust and elixir](./hacks/wip)
 - [testing elixir](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/testing-elixir/9781680508918/)
 
My interests outside computer science are primarily philosophy and economics. My current bookshelf is:
- Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman [August]

I am _always_ looking for great recommendations! via [github](https://gist.github.com/hailelagi/26263ee81eebd06c5e62b98617854581)
