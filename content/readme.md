Hi, I'm Haile (pronunciation: [haɪlə](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haile_Selassie.ogg)).

I've had previous production experience with [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
and [go](https://go.dev/) on the server side and javascript([vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [react](https://reactjs.org/)) on the client.
I hope to write more elixir and/or [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

My interests outside **computer science** are primarily **philosophy** and **economics**.
I'm currently reading: _metaprogramming elixir_

I'm currently learning metaprogramming, sql and network programming. Eventually diving into distributed systems and cryptography.

I am _always_ looking for great recommendations! via [github](https://gist.github.com/hailelagi/26263ee81eebd06c5e62b98617854581)
