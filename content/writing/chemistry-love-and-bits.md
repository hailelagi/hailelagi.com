## Introduction

The world is a confusing absurd place, and for thousands of years its mysteries have eluded human understanding. 
Eventually though in our collective search for truth we developed systems and methods of reasoning. One such widely 
adopted method is the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) - a way for people to 
observe and experiment.

By recording the observations of phenomena in controlled environments over time and space, scientists are able to 
recognize patterns in changes and from that propose the possible underlying causes of those changes. Most often though, 
these relationships are approximations of real-world behaviour - which is to say are abstractions of how things work.

Abstractions are tools of the mind, much like the more complex "conception of a self", they allow the mind to do all 
sorts of interesting and creative things. The ability to create mental "models" is of note. A model being some representation 
of a physical object or abstraction. A model is difficult to define this definition is inadequate but provided 
to be easy to intuit, think of an orange. Hold the image in your mind. This is a model. Abstractions like force, touch,
love, good or evil are harder to project as an image but are models - i.e representations of "things" created by the mind. 
These tools of the mind allow us to represent "real things" or "systems" as relationships of quantities defined by some
axioms formally defined in mathematical theory.

A simple example to illustrate this is [Hooke's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law) built on top of Newton's
 laws of motion:

`Force of a spring = deformation of spring * spring constant` ... (1)

This is a linear mathematical model expressed as equation 1 that describes the relationship of how an elastic material 
behaves under the influences of some external "energy" acting upon it up to some limit.

The relationship is easy enough to compute because the underlying equation is expressed in traditional algebra. We can 
often translate this into an algorithm and investigate its behaviour under a variety of circumstances. This is called a 
_simulation_.

The rise of computing power and the growth of the internet has changed everything. A [Cray-1's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1)
raw computational power of 80 million floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) is an order of magnitude smaller than
the iPhone 5s. (Nick T., 2014) This has enabled a significantly larger subset of the population to engage in creative computer-assisted
 problem solving.
