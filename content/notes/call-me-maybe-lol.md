Documenting solving the fly.io distributed systems challenges. The title of this post is inspired by [kyle kingsbury's post title](https://aphyr.com/posts/316-call-me-maybe-etcd-and-consul). I thought it'd also be funny to play it on repeat while solving/writing this :)

## 1. echo
saying hello world! but distributed systems style, it's mostly boilerplate setup, 
reading the maelstrom docs and the go client docs, we instantiate a maelstrom node/binary, define an RPC style handler and return messages:

```go
func main() {
	n := maelstrom.NewNode()

	// Register a handler for the "echo" message that responds with an "echo_ok".
	n.Handle("echo", func(msg maelstrom.Message) error {
		// Unmarshal the message body as an loosely-typed map.
		var body map[string]any
		if err := json.Unmarshal(msg.Body, &body); err != nil {
			return err
		}

		// Update the message type.
		body["type"] = "echo_ok"

		// Echo the original message back with the updated message type.

		return n.Reply(msg, body)
	})

	// Execute the node's message loop. This will run until STDIN is closed.
	if err := n.Run(); err != nil {
		log.Printf("ERROR: %s", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```


## 2. Unique ID Generation (What time is it?)

In a single node/computer, generation of unique ids is typically achieved using a growing monontonic sequence such as a counter or the system clock.

In the view of a distributed system where each node could increment this counter simultaneously and the [the system clock is unreliable](https://tigerbeetle.com/blog/three-clocks-are-better-than-one) there needs to be some way of solving this [global clock synchronisation problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAyW-4LeXZo) of not only skewing different "times" but logical ordering of events. What to do?

1. A pseudo logical event clock where we can represent casual dependencies as combinations of properties of our system for e.g the system clock + orignating node id + a random request id(tie breaker). Luckily for this challenge there aren't requirements for **space** or **ordering** or **causality**, only **global uniqueness**, which is naive but isn't too far off more sophisticated schemes [^1] [^2]

```go
func genNaive(nodeID string) int64 {
	requestID := strconv.FormatInt(rand.Int63n(100), 10)
	sequenceId := strconv.FormatInt(time.Now().UnixMicro(), 10)
	originId := nodeID[1:]

	identity := originId + requestID + sequenceId

	if id, err := strconv.ParseInt(identity, 10, 64); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
		return 0
	} else {
		return id
	}
}
```

2. hash a seed over a really large key space (2**128 - 1) - a uuid.

3. The use of a central authority such as an atomic clock or a "time server".

## 3. Broadcast

Our first "official" distributed algorithm! a way to gossip information to nodes. Incrementally we scaffold basic messaging,
sending data efficiently, simulating network partitions, variable latencies and interesting node topologies!

```go
```

## 4. Grow-Only Counter

```go
```

## 5. Kafka-Style Log

```go
```

## 6. Totally-Available Transactions

```go
```
