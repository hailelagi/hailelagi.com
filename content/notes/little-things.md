What I want:
1. bring down cycle time
2. cut scope
3. solve real problems, not fighting technology

The spectrum of largest time I spend:

- memory unsafety is unproductive
- unchecked arithmetic is unproductive
- bit shifting for funsies is time expensive
- not c, not c++ iteration time is slow, bugs abound, takes too long
- unsafe rust is just as bad as c or c++ or perhaps worse?
