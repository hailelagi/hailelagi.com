generated with: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BPlusTree.html, please feel free to explore!

assumptions:
- *non-decreasing order* and *max degree* of 3
- elements(N) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

## Insertion
Inserting, find target leaf and insert the keys `1` and `2` target == root.

green box is our internal node & root node.
the "contents" are the leaf node.

When we insert key `3`? we have our first _overflow_ causing a split:
![split](/split.png)
`2` is _promoted_ and contents are split in two, we recurse from the bottom up.

What if we add key `4` our tree looks weird doesn't it:

and now have to "rebalance" our tree with incoming five:
![rebalance](/rebalance.png)

## Search
searching is an Olog(N) operation!

just a reminder this is _really powerful_ if n = 1 billion, dominance:
- lg(n) = 0.030 Î¼s
- f(n) = 1 sec
- nlg(n) = 29.9 sec
- n ** 2 = 31.7 years
- 2 ** n = :/

with a branching factor of 1001 and height 3 can store over one billion keys:
num keys = branching factor ^ height - 1 * branching factor - 1

point and range queries follow the same logarithmic path.

## Deletion

Let's remove 4.

First we find 4 using binary search, then re-arrange our pointers and rebalance:
![delete](/delete.png)

Rebalancing involves restoring our ordered structure and keeping pointers valid and 
performing a merge.
