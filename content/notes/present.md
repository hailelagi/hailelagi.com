assumptions:
*non-decreasing order* and *max degree* of 3

## Insertion
Inserting the keys `1` and `2`:

What happens when we insert key `3`? we have our first split:
![split](/split.png)

Let's add key `4` our tree looks unbalanced doesn't it:
![balance](/balance.png)

and now have to "rebalance" our tree with incoming five:

## Search
searching is an Olog(N) operation!

just a reminder this is _really powerful_ if n = 1 billion, dominance:
- lg(n) = 0.030 Î¼s
- f(n) = 1 sec
- nlg(n) = 29.9 sec
- n ** 2 = 31.7 years
- 2 ** n = :/

with a branching factor of 1001 and height 3 can store over one billion keys:
num keys = branching factor ^ height - 1 * branching factor - 1

## Deletion

Let's remove 4.

First we find 4 using binary search, then re-arrange our pointers and rebalance:
