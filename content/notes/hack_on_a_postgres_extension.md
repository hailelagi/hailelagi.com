this will probably be my next project, doing something with postgres.

https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx

### Pros
- it's actual database development: on a platform rather DIY from scratch(impossible goal), knowledge of internals is helpful.
- I like postgres/sort of already know it a little from a user perspective.
- breaking databases is fun, it feels good to add and remove things, hack around.

### getting better at hacking on postgres
- re-read: https://www.interdb.jp/pg/
read: https://edu.postgrespro.com/postgresql_internals-14_en.pdf

- build an extension end to end.
- practice C.
- practice unsafe rust.
- find sometime to peruse the mailing list for ideas on current issues and "easy" patches
- peruse the pg discords
