Hi, come read [systems performance!](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2020-07-15/systems-performance-2nd-edition.html)

Every week after April 6th 2025, we’ll meet _async_, over **text only channels** on a little [discord server](https://discord.gg/Dm5MGND8) at 7pm UTC every Saturday, I believe systems performance is a daunting but fun and rewarding book, if you’re an SRE, work on a backend, someone that likes systems programming or just wondering how netflix’s servers stay snappy take a peek! every week someone will volunteer to drive the discussion of the chapter – and if no one does -- I will, as this is a tiny experimental book club, please help and don’t let me be crushed! Solo leveling **is not** as fun in real life! 

The discussions are what we make of them, good, bad, rewarding & relevant, fun -- or not. It does not matter what your experience level is. It would be preferrable to have folks who know what they're talking about, but dumb questions – are highly encouraged!

Discussions can be driven however the volunteer likes, I personally prefer they not be summaries or presentations – It is expected we’ve all read the chapter and want to contribute insights, stories from work, ask questions etc

As this is an experiment -- I have no idea if this will work! If it does not, I will read the book by myself anyway and be sad! If you would like to volunteer for a chapter dm me.
