either a lack time, grit or knowledge/skill I just couldn&rsquo;t make meaningful progress.</p><p>To be fair - at first it <em>seemed</em> like a simple &ldquo;good first issue&rdquo; kind of thing I had no idea what I was opting into, so here&rsquo;s a disclaimer!
We&rsquo;re going to build a type of database! Specifically an in-memory key-value data store &ndash; like Redis! kinda&mldr; sorta.</p><p>But before that context, here&rsquo;s Joe Armstrong explaining why writing correct, fast, well-tested, concurrent & parallel(distributed) programs on modern CPUs is complex and difficult and why erlang/elixir is appealing, it comes with a concurrent/parallel garbage collector (no global GC pauses, <strong>low-latency by default</strong>), a <strong>shared nothing architecture</strong> that&rsquo;s <strong>multi-core by default</strong> and scales IO bound soft-realtime applications incredibly well with a simple model of concurrency and primitives that encourage thinking about fault tolerance &ndash; did I mention functional programming?</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bo5WL5IQAd0 style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>This covers some wide ranging and complex important topics let&rsquo;s take a peek under the covers of what we say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to when we want shared

In a database for example, you can&rsquo;t just go around copying everything. In the erlang/elixir ecosystem this is solved by leveraging erlang term storage(ets), and it&rsquo;s a key component of the distributed persistent database mnesia.</p><blockquote><p>It would be very difficult, if not impossible to implement ETS purely in Erlang with similar performance. Due to its reliance on mutable data, the functionality of ETS tables is very expensive to model in a functional programming language like Erlang. [1]</p></blockquote><p>Before we get into the bells and whistles of it all, what is it at its core? Conceputally a key-value store seems simple.
What you want to model is an abstract interface that can store data and retrieve it fast, essentially a map/dictionary/associative array abstract data type:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kd>type</span> <span class=nx>Table</span><span class=p>[</span><span class=nx>Key</span> <span class=nx>comparable</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=nx>Value</span> <span class=nx>any</span><span class=p>]</span> <span class=kd>interface</span> <span class=p>{</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In terms of an api for this <code>Table</code>, we&rsquo;re looking to define the options <code>bag</code>, <code>duplicate_bag</code>, <code>set</code> and <code>ordered_set</code>.
If familiar with <code>table relations</code> in relational databases, think of the key-value mapping like so:</p><ol><li>one to one(1:1) = <code>set</code></li><li>one to one(but with order) = <code>ordered_set</code></li><li>one to many(1:N) = <code>bag</code></li><li>many to many(N:N) <code>duplicate_bag</code></li></ol><p>These allow us to model all sorts of interesting properties like <em>referential integrity</em> this will be important <em>later</em>. For now,
you might be thinking why not implement this by just throwing a hashmap underneath and that works for types <code>set</code>, <code>bag</code> and <code>duplicate_bag</code>.
Infact hashmaps are ubiquitious [4] [5] [6] and contain excellent properties when the data model fits in working memory, however most implementations in standard libraries are not thread safe. CPU cores need to synchronize data access to avoid corrupting data or reading inconsistent or stale data.</p><p>In rust - sharing an <code>std::collections::hash_map::HashMap</code> requires wrapping it in two things:</p><ol><li>an atomic reference count <code>Arc&lt;T></code></li><li>a mutex or some other sync mechanism because the type does not impl <code>Send</code> & <code>Sync</code></li></ol><p>If your program and data only has to exist within a single thread of execution that&rsquo;s great, but <em>web servers</em> tend to need to handle <em>concurrent</em> data access. Practical examples of this are caches, rate limiting middleware, session storage, distributed config, simple message queues etc</p><p>Let&rsquo;s wrap it in a mutex from go&rsquo;s std lib&rsquo;s <code>sync</code> package:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kd>type</span> <span class=nx>Map</span><span class=p>[</span><span class=nx>K</span> <span class=kt>string</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=nx>V</span> <span class=nx>any</span><span class=p>]</span> <span class=kd>struct</span> <span class=p>{</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To <code>Read</code> and <code>Write</code> we must acquire <code>*Map.Lock()</code> and release <code>*Map.Unlock()</code>. This works, up to a point &ndash;
but we can do better! We&rsquo;re trying to build a <em>general purpose</em> data store for
key-value data. Global Mutexes are a good solution but you tend to encounter inefficiencies like <em>lock contention</em> on higher values of R/W data access, especially when your hardware can parallelize access when the underlying memory region&rsquo;s slots are partioned perhaps due to hashing across independent memory regions.</p><p>One clever way of getting around this is by using an advanced concurrency technique called fine-grained locking, the general idea is instead of a global mutex we serialise access to specific partitions[1]:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-go data-lang=go><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=kd>type</span> <span class=nx>Map</span><span class=p>[</span><span class=nx>K</span> <span class=kt>string</span><span class=p>,</span> <span class=nx>V</span> <span class=nx>any</span><span class=p>]</span> <span class=kd>struct</span> <span class=p>{</span>

This bottleneck of locks and linearization is the reason databases like postgres and mysql have Multi Version Concurrency Control(MVCC) semantics for pushing reads and writes further using transactions and isolation levels. We&rsquo;ll come back to exploring these fun problems and the tradeoffs and ask the question are locks truely necessary?</p><p>Next, we&rsquo;d like to be able to store both ordered and unordered key value data, hash maps store unordered data so this calls for some sort of additional data structure with fast ordered <code>Table</code> operations for our <code>ordered_set</code>.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Search trees are the &ldquo;go to&rdquo; structure for keeping performant ordered data with balanced read/write performance, by ensuring we keep the &ldquo;search property&rdquo; we can perform on average operations in <code>O(logN)</code> &ndash; if the tree is balanced. Sadly in reality they&rsquo;re bounded by the worst time-complexity of <code>O(h)</code> where h is the height of the tree. What that means is if we get unlucky
with the data - searches can devolve into searching a linked-list. That wouldn&rsquo;t do. Here there are many flavors thankfully.</p><p>Fan favorites include the classics; an AVL Tree, B-Tree or perhaps an LSM Tree, which all come with spices and even more variety.</p><p>In practice we are concerned about much more than order of magnitude choices, we are also interested in how these structures
interact with memory layout, can the data fit in main memory (internal) or is it on disk(external)? is it cache friendly? are the node values blocks of virtual memory or random access? sorting files in a directory is a common example of this problem. What kind of concurrent patterns are enabled? how do they map to our eventual high level API? These questions lead to very different choices in algorithm design.</p><p>What exists in the current erlang runtime system? The data structure chosen previously of which we&rsquo;ll be benchmarking against is something called a <a href=https://www.erlang.org/blog/the-new-scalable-ets-ordered_set/>Contention Adapting Tree</a> [2]. Briefly what&rsquo;s interesting about CA Tree is it dynamically at runtime changes the behaviour and number of locks it holds across the tables it protects depending on nature of contention protecting underneath a sequential ordered data structure such as a treap or AVL Tree.</p><h2 id=concurrency-correctness--going-web-scale>Concurrency, Correctness & Going web scale</h2><p>These days are you a serious software craftsman <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">if you&rsquo;re not at web scale?</a>.</p><p>In our undying, unending pursuit to scale systems further and further we spin webs of complexity. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlwlV4hcBac">Why? who knows, it&rsquo;s provocative.</a></p><p>Let&rsquo;s put on our scaling cap. Previously we mentioned fine-grained locking as a technique that could lead to better write performance but at the cost of complexity and read performance &ndash; a related application of this technique is called &ldquo;sharding&rdquo;.</p><p>Sharding is a wonderful idea, if one hashmap won&rsquo;t work, let&rsquo;s scale <em>horizontally</em>, have you tried two? or perhaps sixteen or thirty two?
Java&rsquo;s <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> and rust&rsquo;s <code>DashMap</code> are defacto examples of this. However we need to ask isn&rsquo;t this getting complex? can we still understand the system? most importantly can we guarantee <em>correctness?</em></p><p>As it turns out most databases need to ensure certain guarantees with respect to performance, concurrency and correctness and here we discuss the elusive idea of a &ldquo;transaction&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ve probably heard the acronymn ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability. What does that mean for ets? Lucky for us, we can cast away the durability requirement as our data set must fit in working memory(for now). That leaves us with:</p><ul><li>Atomicity</li><li>Consistency</li><li>Isolation</li></ul><h3 id=atomicity>Atomicity</h3><p>At the level of hardware what is atomicity? It&rsquo;s a special instruction set.
An example of an interface to this is go&rsquo;s <a href=https://pkg.go.dev/sync/atomic>sync/atomic</a>.
This instruction gives a certain <em>guarantee</em>,that you can perform an operation without <em>side effects</em> like another process
peeking a half-baked result. You get a pie or you don&rsquo;t &ndash; however we&rsquo;re getting ahead of ourselves as this part has to do with <em>visibility</em>.</p><p>Now here&rsquo;s where we have to be careful. ETS operations are semantically &ndash; <strong>independently atomic</strong>[9].</p><p>Every operation such as a read, write or multi_write on a table are atomic for a single process. In the relational model
you have BEGIN, COMMIT & ROLLBACK semantics where you can group multiple write operations and pretend they&rsquo;re a single atomic operation. Mnesia builds upon
ets and supports <a href=https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/mnesia/mnesia_chap4#atomicity>grouping multiple writers</a> with <a href=https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/mnesia#transaction-1>transactions</a> but ets does not.</p><h2 id=isolation>Isolation</h2><p>Isolation is really about how we define the <em>access</em> rules of a <code>Table</code>. In ets we have different access modes:</p><ul><li>public - Reader/Writer groups</li><li>protected - RWMutex in principle</li><li>private - exclusive Mutex</li></ul><p>todo:
We hinted at why the MVCC paradigm [8] exists. Another optimisation inline with the <em>more is better</em> philosophy are reader and writer groups like we saw when we introduced the concept of fine-grained locks. In relational database like postgres you might be familiar with the table access patterns such as FOR UPDATE or ACCESS EXCLUSIVE in mnesia you have similar <a href=https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/mnesia#lock-2>locking semantics</a></p><p>todo:</p><h2 id=consistency>Consistency</h2><p>Consistency is a tricky topic. In one definition we can think of <em>referential integrity</em> as consistent property and in another
we can think of</p><h2 id=the-dumpster-fire-that-is-garbage-collection>The dumpster fire that is garbage collection</h2><p>So far we haven&rsquo;t really had to worry about garbage collection. We&rsquo;ve disscussed reading and writing data to the <code>Table</code>, but not deletion.</p><p>We know we cannot statically allocate memory for our <code>Table</code> because we don&rsquo;t know its contents at compile time and we must do dynamic memory allocation.
What happens when we delete a node in the <code>Table</code> or <code>OrderedTable</code>?</p><p>A brief mention of rust mentioned using atomic reference counts an implementation of the strategy <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-04-rc.html>reference counting</a> and in go where this operation is automatic and opaque to the user we didn&rsquo;t really have to worry about it. The resource allocation strategy is tightly coupled to the programming language and environment we intend our concrete key value implementation to eventually live, so at this point we bid farewall to go and carry on with the intricacies of low-level memory management in rust.</p><p>Garbage collection is a complex topic but a brief overview of options are:</p><ul><li>malloc, calloc(), free() and realloc()</li><li>refrence counting</li><li>automatic garbage collection (tracing & mark and sweep etc)</li><li>Custom memory allocation</li></ul><h2 id=a-detour-for-just-enough-web-assembly>A detour for just enough web assembly</h2><p>tdlr; crash course in just enough webassembly</p><h1 id=gotta-go-fast>Gotta Go Fast</h1><p>at what cost?</p><ul><li>use of lock free data structures/behaviour across reads - concurrent skip list crash course, why?</li></ul><p>intro to lock free techniques[3]</p><h2 id=more-complex-types>More complex Types</h2><ul><li>conformance and integration with/into the firefly runtime</li></ul><p>So far these examples have been somewhat generic but the underlying implementation only allowed simple types a key of type <code>string</code> and a value of <code>int</code>.
This is intentionally done in order not to distract from other concepts, but if we really want a general key value store we need to allow many types.
In this case we want to allow every type supported by the erlang runtime systems.</p><h2 id=persistence>Persistence</h2><p>Implementing the DETS api</p><h2 id=the-query-parser>The query parser</h2><p>Every good database needs ergonimics features fo good querying!
