it would compute these instructions one by one, but while it did that - it would “freeze up” you couldn’t really do much
else with it. At the time, computer hardware was pretty limited, it had a single CPU core
(something that executes instruction sets) which did pretty much everything, one by one - computer scientists were not particularly
satisfied with this, and they <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion>found a solution</a>.</p><p>In essence, execution of two or more computations is possible - given it is guaranteed that both read
data from the same source, but writing could lead to inconsistency, commonly known as a <em>data race</em> or <em>race condition</em>.
Today our computers have multiple cores - they can do a lot more stuff than they <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law>used to</a>,
but we need some way to guarantee or make it really hard for this to happen.</p><p>The world of concurrency is fascinating, lots of languages design mechanisms around this problem known as
<strong>concurrency primitives</strong>, allowing software creators to fashion applications and software systems that perform much better
than their sequential alternative, however we are most interested in a cursory glance into the BEAM
(Erlang’s virtual machine). For brief context, a virtual machine is just software - an abstraction over the basic
hardware of a computer allowing a layer of execution on top of it. A common example being the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
The elixir/erlang source code is parsed and transformed into a set of intermediary files prefixed with <code>.beam</code> that the
virtual machine can understand known as bytecode, via the <code>C</code> programming language. From here it is translated into
assembly/machine instruction bits <a href=#references>[1]</a>.</p><p><strong>source code</strong> &mdash;> <strong>c interface</strong> &mdash;> <strong>bytecode</strong></p><p>Most of the interesting <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model>concurrency primitives</a> that erlang/elixir provide
are built on top of the <a href=https://ferd.ca/it-s-about-the-guarantees.html>guarantees</a> this virtual machine provides such
as immutable state. The single basic unit being a process <a href=#references>[2]</a> <a href=#references>[3]</a> -
an isolated sequential unit of computation which is managed by a scheduler an important construct.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Note: you may think of a process as a kind of &#34;green thread&#34;,
if familiar with the concept. Otherwise thinking of them
as an abstract unit of sequential computation is fine.
</code></pre><h2 id=erlangs-scheduler>Erlang’s scheduler</h2><p>The scheduler within the BEAM runtime (not an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)>operating system scheduler</a>),
talks to the operating system via <a href=https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/4_Threads.html>threads</a> and
manages the <a href=https://hamidreza-s.github.io/erlang/scheduling/real-time/preemptive/migration/2016/02/09/erlang-scheduler-details.html>how and when</a>
of computations (processes - in the vm). It does something called <em>preemptive scheduling</em> which requires making
a nuanced trade off - all processes are treated as equal and given a tiny block of time/memory to execute, whether this
is enough for a process is irrelevant. It sacrifices the efficient allocation of resources to processes that need it most
to make some important guarantees which make fault tolerance possible:</p><ol><li>High availability</li><li>Isolated failure states</li></ol><p>This constant <em>context switching</em> gives guarantees creating a system that is dependable - allowing the creation
of processes that inspect others, we can leverage this information to make intelligent deductions about what is happening
within the system at runtime and design strategies to deal with and understand crashes and fail states,
while also providing concurrent primitives that naturally scale across distributed systems,
changing very little about the core system.</p><p>A typical illustration of erlang&rsquo;s introspective superpower is <code>:observer</code> which ships by default. Pop <code>:observer.start()</code>
into any <code>iex</code> session and watch the magic.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class=line><span class=cl>user@my-pc $ iex

and lets it run for a bit, if the process does not finish(an infinite loop for example), the scheduler moves on to
<code>child_two</code> and so on, checking up on each process, computing a bit. Scheduling multiple cores works the same way, only
you&rsquo;d need a way to manage the global name space of running processes.

built into erlang, offering you the tools to create and design highly fault-tolerant, self-healing systems, sometimes
at the cost of <em>absolute runtime performance</em>. You can see this with need to replicate data structures and performing
computationally intensive tasks that would make sense to be processed sequentially. Do not despair however, you can
carefully poke a hole into the runtime through the C interface via

heavy-lifting if required to a service in a different language. Let&rsquo;s explore at a high level the conceptual
