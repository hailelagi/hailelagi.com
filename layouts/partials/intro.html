<p>Hi! I'm Haile!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a software engineer interested in databases and distributed systems. I currently work on problems related
to storage at <a href="https://www.category.xyz">category.xyz</a>, before that on the servers of financial exchanges/payments(crypto).</p>

<span>I enjoy writing, coffee and <a href="./bookshelf">good books</a>. You'll probably find me hacking on open source, writing or building random ideas. </span>
