<p>Hi! I'm Haile!</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer, interested in databases and distributed systems, I've most recently worked on the storage engine for the execution client of a layer one, before that on the servers/backend of financial exchanges/payments. </p>

<span>I enjoy writing, coffee and <a href="./bookshelf">good books</a>. You'll probably find me hacking on open source,
    writing or building random ideas. </span>
