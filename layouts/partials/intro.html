<p>Hi! I'm Haile!</p>

<p> I most recently worked on blockchain infrastructure related to storage engines, 
    before that on the servers of financial exchanges/payments in crypto.</p>

<span>I enjoy writing, coffee and <a href="./bookshelf">good books</a>. You'll probably find me hacking on open source,
    writing or building random ideas. </span>
