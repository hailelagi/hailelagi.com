<p>Hi! I'm Haile!</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer, interested in systems programming, databases and distributed systems. I've most recently worked on a storage engine for the execution client of a layer one, before that on the servers/backend of financial exchanges/payments. </p>


<span>I occasionally enjoy writing, coffee, <a href="./bookshelf">good books</a> and recently <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/136012731">running</a>. </span>
