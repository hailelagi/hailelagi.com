<p>Hi! I'm Haile, pronunciation:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Haile_Selassie.ogg"> haɪlə</a>
</p>

<p> I'm trying to figure out what to work on next! In the meantime, I'm mostly writing <a href="/hacks/tsunami/">rust</a>
     and trying to <a href="/roadmap"> learn/build stuff</a></p>

<p>Previously I've worked as a software developer for <b>a little over 2 years</b>. In that time, I've worked on financial
    technology with
    <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">elixir</a>, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">ruby</a> and <a
        href="https://go.dev/">go</a> — typically event-driven and most recently distributed systems with a little
    javascript/typescript - <a href="https://reactjs.org/">react.js</a> on the client.
</p>

<p>I started out experimenting with python in the middle of my chemical engineering bachelor's and somehow started
    building stuff on the internet.</p>
