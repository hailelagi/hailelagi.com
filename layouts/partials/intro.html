<p>Hi! I'm Haile!</p>

<p> I write software for fun and profit?</p>

<p/>I've been funemployed and looking since January 2024! I've written professionally for about ~two years, in <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">elixir</a>, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">ruby</a> and <a
    href="https://go.dev/"> go(lang) </a> â€” typically on the backend of server side products. You might find me writing open source <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust</a> sometimes.
